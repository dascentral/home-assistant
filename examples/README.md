```

## Tips for Learning

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic examples
- **Understand First**: Read through code before using
- **Modify Gradually**: Change one thing at a time
- **Test Safely**: Use test devices when possible
- **Document Changes**: Note what you modified and why

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Time-Based Automation
Trigger actions at specific times or relative to sunrise/sunset.

### Pattern: State-Change Automation  
React when sensors or devices change state.

### Pattern: Condition-Based Logic
Perform different actions based on current conditions.

### Pattern: Multi-Stage Sequences
Chain multiple actions with waits and conditions.

### Pattern: Template-Based Decisions
Use templates for complex logic and calculations.
